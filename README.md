# Quant-research-toolkit
A Python toolkit for portfolio analytics and investment research.
This repo includes:

- Fama-French 5-Factor model (alpha, beta, style tilts)
- Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return)
- Treynor Ratio (return per unit of market beta)
- Value at Risk models
  - Historical
  - Parametric
  - Monte Carlo

The goal of this toolkit is to take a stock or portfolio, run it through the core quant diagnostics and return interpretable outputs that help with real investment decisions.
I use these tools to assist the PM and both Macro + Equity teams by converting qualitative ideas into numbers — so we can see:

- Where returns actually come from (factors vs true alpha)
- How much risk the position is taking per return
- How vulnerable the name is to downside
